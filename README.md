# ATRASH

**ATRASH**  website is developed using Django Framework as part of Portfolio Project 3 for my Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp at WAES useing Code Institute.

The target audience for the website would be businesses or individuals who are interested in buying recycled materials. The website could provide information about the types of materials that are available for purchase, pricing, and delivery options. The target audience could include manufacturers, construction companies, and individuals who are interested in using recycled materials for DIY projects and institutions.

You can view the live site here: >>>>>>>>>>>>>>

  # User Experience - UX

## Site Aims
* Provide a convenient and affordable service for individuals and businesses to have their trash collected and disposed of responsibly.
* Reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills or pollutes the environment by recycling and repurposing collected materials.
* Educate the public about the importance of responsible waste management and the environmental impact of their consumption habits.
* Promote a circular economy by creating new products and materials from recycled waste, thereby reducing the need for virgin resources.
* Partner with local organizations and businesses to support sustainable development and community-building initiatives.

## Agile Methodology
The Agile Methodology was used to plan this project. This was implemented through Trello and the Project Board. Through the use of the Kanban board, the project was divided into a few different sections:

* Doing
* Code Review
* Testing
* Done

Please find my Kanban Board made with Trello  [here](https://trello.com/b/x9zPyGwh/kanban-template).

## Database Diagram

ERDPlus was used to create a database schema to visualise the types of custom models the project requires. This schema was used as a guide to what needed to be added to each model. Below is the Database structure that this project is based on.

# Walktrough

## Steps
All the pages got a navbar and a footer.
* The index has an order burron that will bring you to the order page.
* The order page gives you the possibility to choose the service you prefere, you will have to provide thr deatails, that will be the address where the service will be executed. Press the button and it will take the user to the pay page.
* When you get to the pay page you'll see what you orxdered. I gave the option to to pay with paypal. When the payment is confirmed you'll see a payment confirmation page.

* From the nav bar you can access the about page that gives a overview of what we do.
* There is the option to see what the manu items are un the manu page, but you can't buy the product from that page.

* If you whant to access as a staff member you have to press the login link on the footer. This will require a password and when you login you will be able to see all the orders and the status.

* To login as the admin you need to access the django admin page, login and you will be able to modify the items on the website, the staff that can access.


| **Unfix Bug** |
| ----------- | 
| When a logged in user adds a new post, the post slug should automatically be created from the post title. But the slug field is empty in the database. Slug is a required field when admin publishes a draft post, so here admin manually filled the slug field during publishing. Below is the screenshot from the post model in admin panel and view for Add Post.<br><details><summary>Empty slug screenshot</summary><img src="assets/empty-slug.jpg"></details><details><summary>Add Post View</summary><img src="assets/addPostView.jpg"></details>
