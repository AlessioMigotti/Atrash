# ATRASH

**ATRASH**  website is developed using Django Framework as part of Portfolio Project 3 for my Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp at WAES useing Code Institute.

The target audience for the website would be businesses or individuals who are interested in buying recycled materials. The website could provide information about the types of materials that are available for purchase, pricing, and delivery options. The target audience could include manufacturers, construction companies, and individuals who are interested in using recycled materials for DIY projects and institutions.

You can view the live site here: >>>>>>>>>>>>>>

  # User Experience - UX

## Site Aims
* Provide a convenient and affordable service for individuals and businesses to have their trash collected and disposed of responsibly.
* Reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills or pollutes the environment by recycling and repurposing collected materials.
* Educate the public about the importance of responsible waste management and the environmental impact of their consumption habits.
* Promote a circular economy by creating new products and materials from recycled waste, thereby reducing the need for virgin resources.
* Partner with local organizations and businesses to support sustainable development and community-building initiatives.

## Agile Methodology
The Agile Methodology was used to plan this project. This was implemented through Trello and the Project Board. Through the use of the Kanban board, the project was divided into a few different sections:

* Doing
* Code Review
* Testing
* Done

Please find my Kanban Board made with Trello  [here](https://trello.com/b/x9zPyGwh/kanban-template).
